# Personal Website Portfolio - Andy Chen

This is my website that is created to unleash my own creativity while also providing valuable information about myself. It will display information such as what I want to become in the future, a brief introduction about myself, and all of my projects that I've completed. The main goal for this project was to create an elegant website archive about what my achievements are for people around the world to interact with and see.

# Implementation
This site utilizes a combination of the following:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- EmailJS
- Chart.JS
The HTML and CSS will handle the basic structuring of the website skeleton and styling using CSS.
The JavaScript will handle all the events and provide a smooth website experience for the user with animations such as providing smooth fading transitions for events and a clean, radial cursor effect.
EmailJS will be used to send information to if you were to have any queries or would to learn or know more about me. Chart.JS was used to simply display some graphics about myself as that will be shown in my About Me page.

# Using the Website
Once entering my website (https://andyc780.github.io/wesbite-personal-portfolio/), you will be greeted with a smooth fade-in animation with a very small introduction of what I want to be and as well cool star decorations that bounce off the webpage. It will also display 3 icons on what describes myself and skills combined as I am a person interested in mathematics, STEM and of course, enjoy playing video games. Click once to advance forward to my navigation bar as it should be indicated near the bottom of the page. 
- After advancing forward, you can click on the following links to redirect you to a certain part in my webisite such as my projects section, about me section, or if you want to contact me via email as it will then be sent through EmailJS.
And after all of that, that should be everything! Have fun navigating around my webiste and learning more about me and the projects that I've created along my journey as there will also be more greater projects to be created in the future!
